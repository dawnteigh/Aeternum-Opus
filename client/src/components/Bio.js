      <h1>Hey, I'm Donte.</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a full-stack web developer. I'm most well-versed with React + Ruby on Rails, but I have used other technologies as well. I can quickly get up to speed with any language or framework to meet project needs; same concepts, different syntax. Let's <a href="/contact">talk</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not glued to my computer, I enjoy cooking, playing tennis or disc golf, craft beer, and karaoke.
