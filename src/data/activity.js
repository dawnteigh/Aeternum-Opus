    entry: `Nothing too big to take away from today. I am a little more clear on when to merge and when to rebase with Git, but most everything else was just review. Last part of the course has me making a contribution to the <a href='https://github.com/Codecademy/docs'>Codecademy Docs</a> on Github. I'm going to try to get that done tomorrow, but I also will be attending a couple of virtual events as part of Flatiron's Career Week, as well as an in-person Dallas Software Developers meetup. Should be an exciting, busy day.`

    entry: `Closed out the Java course, with the last section being about 2D array traversal. Row-major order was second nature to me at this point, but I'd never used column-major order before, so it threw me for a bit of a loop... get it? I just need to remember that converting to column-major traversal is as simple as flipping the terminating conditions of the nested loops AND the accessor indices. Two days left in my <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> trial, but I think I'll refrain from trying to cram another language into my brain... for now. Next up: a course on Git and Github.`

    entry: `Nearly finished up Java today. Everything I covered today was at least vaguely familiar to me from my time learning JavaScript and Ruby through Flatiron. Seeing core programming concepts executed through slightly different means only serves to reinforce my understanding of them, even if I don't end up programming in Java a whole bunch. I'll be honest though, defining an Array by wrapping it in curly braces elicited a visceral reaction from me. Off to bed now, where I will continue to type <code>public static void main(String[] args){}</code> in my dreams.`

    entry: `Slight pivot in plans; decided to make the most of my <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> free trial and started a Java course! So I'm addicted to learning, sue me. But going from TypeScript to another compiled language just made sense! There was a bit of a learning curve at first (I must have forgotten something like 2,147,483,647 semicolons), but by the end of the Object Oriented section I was breezing through. Looking forward to day 2!`

    entry: `Wrapped up the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> TypeScript course today. Finally got to learn about the interfaces I've been seeing when I look at TS code. As I suspected, they are most heavily used in OOP, and are very much the 'type' counterpart of a class. I've got my little certificate that says I took the time to learn TS; now it's time for me to prove that I know TS. I might watch a few more videos, then try to convert 'Word of Mouth' to use TypeScript, Redux and all. <br/><br/>Also got to meet and chat with a mobile developer at the coffee shop after they recognized the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> code editor on my screen. Super nice guy. It's always awesome when you encounter other developers in the wild -- and make new LinkedIn connections!`

    entry: "TypeScript is cool! Learned about nearly all the types and their annotations today (starting on union types tomorrow). On completion of this course, I expect I'll be going through my repos and making sure everything is type-safe, like an expectant parent babyproofing their house."

    entry: `Today was mostly for job applications after stress testing my shiny new portfolio site (had to fix one link after switching to HashRouter). I did find some time to hop over to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and start learning some TypeScript, though. The utility of types has been apparent to me from the jump, but actually sitting down and working with the TypeScript compiler has me super motivated to continue learning and start updating some of my projects to use TS.`

    entry: "Finally put the finishing touches on this little portfolio site. Spent a lot of time agonizing over CSS, but I feel that it was worth it. The next time I undertake something similar, I'll be able to move a lot faster. I certainly became stronger at using flexbox! Programmatically disabling scroll using component state (when rendering the video player) was something new for me as well. Site goes live tonight!"
