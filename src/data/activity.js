Can't wait to write code for a mockup from actual designers!`

I had run into an issue where two NavLinks had similar enough paths (/courses and /courses/new) that they would both appear active when only one of them was. Adding the 'end' prop to the Courses NavLink changed the matching logic so that only the end of the end of the path would be matched, and only the correct button received the "active" class. Kind of a slow day.`

As for the rest of today, I'm going to update project descriptions and create a sort of 'projects + technologies' to-do list for myself.

I'm gonna let the whole 'let' thing slide.`

Yes, I'm learning how to be a Swiftie (is that the right term?), capitalizing on the ol' <a href='https://www.codecademy.com/learn' target="_blank">Codecademy</a> free trial that ends on the 20th.

Going to dive into Loops, Arrays, Maps, and something called Structs tomorrow. Should be fun. While I was working through the material, I noticed that the code blocks in the lecture portions for some reason had white backgrounds, which matched the background of the container element and rendered some of the text unreadable (selecting barely helped). My first thought was <em>somebody somewhere has goofed</em>, but then I thought to just open the browser's dev tools and change the element's background to black myself. Look at me, I'm a web developer!`

    entry: `<img src="https://go.dev/images/gophers/ladder.svg" alt="Go Gopher" class="entry-pic" />Free trial got extended 7 days, so I'll be taking a look at Golang. Liking what I see so far, especially how clean and concise importing and aliasing multiple packages looks. I'm going to take it slow with this one so I can also carve out time to code in the other languages I've picked up this week.<br/><br/>Attended a virtual event through Flatiron today that provided a glimpse into the world of data visualization, complete with a swift demonstration of some advanced Tableau operations. It appeared to be a low-code gig for the most part, but the case statement syntax did resemble something of a cross between a switch statement and a SQL command. Regardless of whether or not I can see myself becoming a data analyst, it's pretty cool to gain perspective on different technical fields and specializations. The Dallas Software Developers meetup was equally enlightening, with DFW area hiring managers and recruiters from different tech disciplines on the panel to provide insights into what stands out to them in an applicant. I felt validated in some of the things I'm doing, but I also came away with a few new tactics that I'm eager to implement into my own personal strategy. I'm super grateful to the guests and the group organizers for donating their time and sharing their wisdom to help prop up the tech community as a whole. Excited for the next one!`

Row-major order was second nature to me at this point, but I'd never used column-major order before, so it threw me for a bit of a loop... get it? I just need to remember that converting to column-major traversal is as simple as flipping the terminating conditions of the nested loops AND the accessor indices. Two days left in my <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> trial, but I think I'll refrain from trying to cram another language into my brain... for now.

Seeing core programming concepts executed through slightly different means only serves to reinforce my understanding of them, even if I don't end up programming in Java a whole bunch. I'll be honest though, defining an Array by wrapping it in curly braces elicited a visceral reaction from me. Off to bed now, where I will continue to type <code>public static void main(String[] args){}</code> in my dreams.`

Finally got to learn about the interfaces I've been seeing when I look at TS code. As I suspected, they are most heavily used in OOP, and are very much the 'type' counterpart of a class. I've got my little certificate that says I took the time to learn TS; now it's time for me to prove that I know TS. I might watch a few more videos, then try to convert 'Word of Mouth' to use TypeScript, Redux and all. <br/><br/>Also got to meet and chat with a mobile developer at the coffee shop after they recognized the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> code editor on my screen.
