    entry: `Today was mostly for job applications after stress testing my shiny new portfolio site (had to fix one link after switching to HashRouter). I did find some time to hop over to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and start learning some TypeScript, though. The utility of types has been apparent to me from the jump, but actually sitting down and working with the TypeScript compiler has me super motivated to continue learning and start updating some of my projects to use TS.`

    entry: "Finally put the finishing touches on this little portfolio site. Spent a lot of time agonizing over CSS, but I feel that it was worth it. The next time I undertake something similar, I'll be able to move a lot faster. I certainly became stronger at using flexbox! Programmatically disabling scroll using component state (when rendering the video player) was something new for me as well. Site goes live tonight!"
